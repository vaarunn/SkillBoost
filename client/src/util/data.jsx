      "Batman is the best instructor I have listened to. Watched several hundred tutorials past two years. Many instructors waste lots of time with personal comments during tutorials. Batman gets right to the point, moving quickly through code examples. I needed to master Javascript and will use SkillBoost exclusively during my career.",

      "Simply the best way to take your development skills to the next level. Batman from SkillBoost already has the best free content out on the internet, but since joining the master class, my confidence in writing more complicated application features has skyrocketed. I cannot thank Batman enough. I am now working as a software engineer while participating in the program, and the team environment he creates simulates what you will experience once you get a job. 10/10",
